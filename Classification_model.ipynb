I have been programming since the age of 11, and researching since 19. I have applied my skills to fields including cybersecurity, computer vision, AI ethics, biometrics, circuit design, cognitive psychology, social networks, and marketing. I received my doctorate in 2014 for work in biologically-inspired AI. For the last five years I worked as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning researcher at Booz Allen Hamilton, mostly doing research in Deep Learning with application to cybersecurity. More recently I have moved to Amazon to help them establish a Data Science team to support AWS Security.\\u2019 This is a moving target, and Donald Knuth defined science as \\u2018everything you can explain to a computer.\\n\\nI am interested in the application of algorithmic techniques to those fields where we can\\u2019t (yet) explain things fully to a computer.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u25e6University of Maryland \\n\\tPh.D. in Computer Science \\tSeptember 2014 \\t\\tDissertation: \\u201cNeurocomputational Methods for Autonomous Cognitive Control\\u201d\\n\\t\\tCommittee chair: James Reggia \\n\\tM.S. in Computer Science \\t\\tMay 2010\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u25e6University of Notre Dame \\n\\tB.S. in Computer Science, Magna cum Laude \\tMay 2006\\n\\nExperience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u25e6Amazon Web Services \\n\\tData Scientist, AWS Security\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 2019 \\u2013 Present\\n\\n\\n\\nI build very large scale data analytic tools to enhance the security of AWS and its customers.

My work focused on Machine Learning research, especially in the domain of computer security. I developed software for feature extraction in cluster environments, and lead a project to evaluate deep learning techniques for our client. I focused on deep neural architectures for application to non-natural languages and cyberdefense, as well as research in neuromorphic computing. I also worked on internal investment projects developing machine learning techniques to mitigate algorithmic bias. Additionally, I assisted my team administratively by acting as our liaison for recruiting.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u25e6UMD Smith School of Business, Center for Complexity in Business \\n\\t\\tDoctoral Research Assistant \\t\\tAugust 2012 \\u2013 September 2014 \\t\\tStudied the role of social networks on conversions to paid memberships in a freemium MMO game en-\\tvironment using large, dynamic, real-world network datasets.
